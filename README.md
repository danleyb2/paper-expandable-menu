Material design: [Menus](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/menus.html)


⚠️ `paper-menu` is now deprecated ⚠️

`<paper-menu>`is deprecated in favour of [`<paper-listbox>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-listbox). The APIs are very similar, and upgrading should be straight forward. For this reason, this element has not been ported to Polymer 2.x, and is *not* a hybrid element. If you use it along side other hybrid elements, please note that it will force your installed Polymer version to 1.x as a result.

`<paper-menu>` implements an accessible menu control with Material Design styling. The focused item
is highlighted, and the selected item has bolded text.

That means the paper-submenu is deprecated too

Thus this is a 'fork' of `paper-menu` that only keeps the `paper-submenu` functionality though renamed to `paper-expandable-menu` for polymer2.0
