## &lt;paper-expandable-menu&gt;

From [`<paper-menu>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-menu)

⚠️ `paper-menu` is now deprecated ⚠️
> `<paper-menu>`is deprecated in favour of [`<paper-listbox>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-listbox). The APIs are very similar,
  and upgrading should be straight forward.
  For this reason, 
  this element has not been ported to Polymer 2.x, and is *not* a hybrid element. 
  If you use it along side other hybrid elements, please note that it will force your installed Polymer version to 1.x as a result.

That means the `paper-submenu` that comes with `paper-menu` is deprecated too

Thus this is a 'fork' of `paper-menu` that only keeps the `paper-submenu` functionality (renamed to `paper-expandable-menu`) and is polymer2.0 compatible
